It is easiest to simply accept such conflicts as a fact of life. Chairs
who can’t handle conflicts fairly shouldn’t be chairs. However, HotCRP
does offer other mechanisms for conflicted reviews.</p>

<p>First, each paper can be assigned a <em>paper administrator</em>: a PC member
who manages that paper’s reviewing and discussion. Use the left-hand side of a ",
$hth->hotlink("submission’s assignment page", "assign"), " to enter its administrator. (You may need to
“Override conflicts” to access the assignment page.)
Paper administrators have full privilege to assign and view reviews for their
papers, and can, for example, use the autoassignment tool, but they cannot change
conference settings. When a paper
has an administrator, chair conflicts cannot be overridden.</p>

<p>Paper administrators make life easy for PC reviewers and greatly restrict
conflicted chairs’ access. Usually this suffices.
For additional privacy, use
<em>review tokens</em>, which are completely anonymous
review slots. To create a token, an administrator
goes to an ", $hth->hotlink("assignment page", "assign"), "
and clicks on “Request review” without entering a name
or email address. This reports the token, a short string of letters and
numbers such as “9HDZYUB”. Any user who knows the token can
enter it on HotCRP’s home page, after which the system lets them
view the paper and anonymously modify the corresponding “Jane Q. Public”
review. True reviewer identities will not appear in HotCRP’s
database or its logs.
For even more privacy, the paper administrator could collect
offline review forms via email and upload them using
review tokens; then even web server access logs store only the
administrator’s identity.</p>\n\n";
